Crypto is a small web project built using NodeJS, ExpressJS, JQuery, and a little bit of HTML.
It computes human-solvable, encrypted messages for entertaining and educational purposes.

Crypto is still under heavy development and in its early stages, but I do hope that it grows into a fun and interesting 
little bit of sotware.
